Idlemon is a variation on a cookie clicker game. The end goal of the game is achieve a certain amount of each resource (fire, water, grass) in as little time as possible. 

A note on how to play:
The game is run from the Main.java class. Before you run the Main.java class, you can set which world challenge you would like to play at the top of the JavaFX.java class. Once you run the Main.java class, an interactive window will pop up with the current resource values printed over the top of the world and one of each (there are three) Idlemon will be randomly located in the world. Click on the Idlemon and then click on either of the two buttons located at the bottom right of the window to either level up the Idlemon to individually convert more resources, or to buy a new version of that Idlemon to have more collectively converting resources. Figure out which method results in the quickest time a world can be satisfied!
